# MWC 2019 Developer Notes

This document provides setup information for developers working on the MWC 2019 Demo.  It
assumes that you are familiar with a typical VOLTHA development setup. If you have a different
way you wish to create your developer environment, please feel free to do so.

Please let me know if there are any errors in this document.

## Module Ownership

I propose that the following companies have initial ownership of the following VOLTHA
modules.  Any developer may make local changes, but if you do not have module ownership, please
create a pull request for any changes that you wish to check in so that the appropriate owner
can properly merge the request into the repository.

- VOLTHA Core: (Adtran) : Includes makefiles, docker-compose files, flow-decomposer, and any sample 
                          network-config.JSON files
- VOLTHA Device Adapters:
- Adtran OLT: (Adtran)
- Adtran ONU: (Adtran)
- Other ONUs: (Telefonica) 

## Initial setup

These steps create an initial developer setup that will allow modification and testing of code
for the MWC-2019 demo.

### VOLTHA setup & initial build

Follow these steps to create the initial set of code. They only need to be performed once

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/source/cord-mwc-2019            # or your own favorite base directory
cd /opt/source/cord-mwc-2019
repo init -u https://gerrit.opencord.org/manifest
repo sync                                     # pulls down CORD, VOLTHA, & tooling (VOLTHA is the most important)

cd incubator
rm -rf voltha                                 # We do not want the master tip
git clone https://github.com/mwc2019/voltha.git

cd voltha
. ./env.sh              # to create your virtual environment

# Now pull down all of the docker dependencies 
make fetch
```

## Building VOLTHA and ONOS
I suggest installing both the forks of VOLTHA and ONOS before building anything.  The modified
Makefile in this fork expects ONOS to be downloaded and a local container built before you
build the VOLTHA containers.

### ONOS (local) setup & initial build
These steps will build a local version of onos and install a container in the local registry that can
be launced for debugging purposes.

```bash
cd /opt/source/cord-mwc-2019/incubator/onos
export ONOS_ROOT=$PWD

source ${ONOS_ROOT}/tools/dev/bash_profile
alias buck='${ONOS_ROOT}/tools/build/onos-buck'

buck build onos    # This will take a while. If buck not found, you cloned a newer ONOS version
```
At this point, you have a locally build version of ONOS.  Now let's install it as a specific onos
version in our docker repository. This is what the VOLTHA makefile will use

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t local-mwc-onos:latest .
```
This command will also take a while (20+ minutes), but once it is finished, a local version of ONOS
with any local changes is now available that the VOLTHA Makefile will use

### ONOS applications
The only ONOS application we will use is the Telefonica OLT application. I have created an additional
onos-apps repository that has the existing VOLTHA onos-apps infrastructure, but no applications. Follow
the next few steps to create this structure on your development machine. You will need to hand copy the
Telefonica OLT application since it is not included in the repository at this time.

```bash
cd /opt/source/cord-mwc-2019/

rm -rf onos-apps            # To delete the ones delivered with 'repo sync'
git clone https://github.com/mwc2019/onos-apps.git
``` 
If we decide not the check in the OLT application, you will need two make two minor edits in
the onos-apps/apps/ctpd-olt directory.

In pom.xml, change the _onos.version_ on line 32 to  **1.13.5**
In pom.xml, change the _api.version_ on line 35 to   **1.13.5**

in app/pom.xml, make the same version changes as above to lines 38 and 39

### VOLTHA setup & initial build
Follow these steps to create the initial set of VOLTHA containers. These steps only need to be performed once.

```bash
cd /opt/source/cord-mwc-2019/incubator/voltha
. ./env.sh              # If not already in the voltha virtual environment

# Build everything. This builds a version of ONOS that we will be replacing later....
make build
```
If all goes well, you should have all the containers you need. Should you get any errors related
to protobuf files, you may want to install 'protoc' as well with the following commands.  This also
can help should you want to run some of the unit test files

```bash
make install-protoc
make build
```

## Launching a minimal MWC-2019 VOLTHA configuration
Typically when I work on VOLTHA, I use a script to stop any previous version of VOLTHA, rebuild the
main VOLTHA core container (since that is what I modify most often) and then start VOLTHA back up. Here
is a copy of that script in case it helps others with starting up VOLTHA.  Note that this does not
start up some of the containers such as graphana since that is not typically used during VOLTHA
development.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# voltha-stop
echo "Stopping any running VOLTHA & ONOS MWC-2019 containers"
docker-compose -f compose/docker-compose-min-system-mwc-2019-test.yml stop >/dev/null 2>&1 &
docker-compose -f compose/docker-compose-local-onos-mwc-2019-test.yml stop >/dev/null 2>&1 &
wait

echo "Removing any running VOLTHA & ONOS MWC-2019 containers"
docker-compose -f compose/docker-compose-min-system-mwc-2019-test.yml rm -f >/dev/null 2>&1
docker-compose -f compose/docker-compose-local-onos-mwc-2019-test.yml rm -f >/dev/null 2>&1

echo "Rebuilding latest VOLTHA"
make voltha || exit 2

echo "Starting VOLTHA MWC-2019 Containers"
docker-compose -f compose/docker-compose-min-system-mwc-2019-test.yml up -d

echo
echo "If you wish to also launch the ONOS MWC-2019 Container, enter the following command"
echo docker-compose -f compose/docker-compose-local-onos-mwc-2019-test.yml up -d onos

echo "Please wait about 10 seconds to allow containers and and any debuggers to connect and run"
```
Note that I do not automatically start up ONOS, you can add that to your script if you always to
plan to debug with ONOS present.

## Launching a MWC-2019 ONOS + Telefonica OLT App Container
This launches a local ONOS container and is meant for debugging.  In the demonstration, the ONOS
will run in a separate VM on the POD.
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
docker-compose -f compose/docker-compose-local-onos-mwc-2019-test.yml up -d onos
```
